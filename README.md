# bamazonDatabase

For this assignment, we were instructed to create a Bamazon shopping application using Node and SQL. The purpose of the assignment is as follows:

Customer Portal:
    * When the user runs the Bamazon application and chooses to run the customer view of the application, they will be prompted with two choices:
        * The first option: The user can choose to browse the inventory- which will display a chart of all the inventory available for purchase in the store. 
            * The inventory is organized by the productID, the name, the department in which the item is located, the price per product, and the quantity of that item.
        * The second option: The user can go "shopping": The user will be asked to input the id of the specific item they would like to purchase and how many of that item they would like to buy.
            * Once they input that information, the customer will be shown a "Bill of Sale" that shows the total price to the customer and the specific item they chose and shows the amount of stock left in the store. 
            * If the customer chooses to buy an amount of an item when there is not enough stock to complete the purchase. The user will be told, that the sale could not be completed becuase of insufficient product stock.
